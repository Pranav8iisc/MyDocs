#1. Introduction
What?
=>3D scanner
  => Digital reconstruction of real world scene.

Why?
=> Applications
   => Medical:Dental model reconstruction for teeth implantation
   => Scientific analysis:Study of dynamics for example, C.F.D, machine component dynamics etc. instead of synthetic models
   => Security: Biometric securtiy-3D face authentication, thumb print authentication
   => Entertainment : XBOX Kinect etc.

How?
=> Key problems
   => At least 2 views required. Stereo correspondence(Add figure triangulation)
   => Mapping measurement units of optical elements to physical units(mm,feets etc.).-> System calibration
   => Triangulation

#2. 3D scanner architecture
    => Figure

#3. System calibration
    => Projector,camera calibration figures

#4. Pattern generation
    => Figure
    => Equations

#5. Pattern projection & capture
    => Figures

#6. Phase wrapping
    => Figures
    => Equation

#7. Phase unwrapping
    => Figures
    => Equations

#8. Absolute phase computation
    => Figures
    => Equations

#9. Triangulation
    => Figures
    => Equations

#10. Accuracy evaluation
     => Procedure
        => Accuracy & precision
     => Results

#11. Current work
     => Issues observed
        => Images of pattern projection wih effect on wrapped phase.

#12. Summary
     => Experimental system with measurement accuracy & precision within 1%.
     => System performance depends on radiometric & geometric state of the scene. 
     => Current work on complete automation.
