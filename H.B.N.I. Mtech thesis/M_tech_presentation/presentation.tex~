\frametitle{Working principle of the developed system}
\begin{enumerate}
\item To perform triangulation \textit{correspondence} between two views is required.
\item Phase-shift approach codifies the projector pixels by assigning a value of phase at every pixel unique only within a single period.
\item Binary patterns assist by assigning a unique period number to each period of the projected sinusoidal fringes,making every point \textit{unique}.
\item Stereo-correspondence is estimated by recovering the phase at each point captured by camera.
\item Geometric calibration of camera and projector further allows for performing triangulation and translation of computed 3D coordinates into physical units.  
\end{enumerate}

%Abstract description of intrinsic parameter calibration algorithm(OpenCV):
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Computes the initial intrinsic parameters(assuming zero distortion coefficients).
%\item The initial camera pose is estimated as if the intrinsic parameters have been already known.
%\item Then the global \textit{Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm} is run to minimize the \textit{reprojection error}.
%\end{enumerate}
OpenCV camera calibration algorithm is used which minimizes:\newline
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\bigg[\sqrt[2]{(observed_x-projected_x)^2+(observed_y-projected_y)^2}\bigg]
\end{equation}
Extrinsic parameters that minimize reprojection error are considered as the \textit{optimal} pose(Rotation \& translation)  
parameters.\newline

Similarly,for projector,
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
w_c*u_i^p \\
w_c*v_i^p \\
w_p
\end{bmatrix}
=\begin{bmatrix}
a_{1,1}^p & a_{1,2}^p & a_{1,3}^p & a_{1,4}^p \\
a_{2,1}^p & a_{2,2}^p & a_{2,3}^p & a_{2,4}^p \\

\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x_i^w\\
y_i^w\\
z_i^w\\
1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
In matrix form it can be written as,
\begin{equation}
PV=F
