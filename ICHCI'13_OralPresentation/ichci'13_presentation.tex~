\frametitle{Phase wrapping}
Assumed illumination model for 3 phase shifted pattern approach:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
& I_1^{v/h}=I_{dc}^{v/h}+I_{mod}^{v/h}*cos(\theta_{v/h}-\alpha) \\
& I_2^{v/h}=I_{dc}^{v/h}+I_{mod}^{v/h}*cos(\theta_{v/h}) \\
& I_3^{v/h}=I_{dc}^{v/h}+I_{mod}^{v/h}*cos(\theta_{v/h}+\alpha)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Hence,
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
& \theta_v=tan^{-1}\bigg[\frac{\sqrt[2]{3}(I_1^v-I_3^v)}{2I_2^v-I_1^v-I_3^v}\bigg],-\pi\leq\theta_v\leq\pi, \\

\frametitle{Accuracy evaluation}
We followed,
\begin{equation}
Accuracy=\frac{\sum_{p=1}^{vp}\Bigg[\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{vs_{p}}\Bigg[\bigg(\frac{|True_{p}-measured_{i}|}{True_{p}}\bigg)*100\Bigg]}{vs_{p}}\Bigg]}{vp}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
Precision=\frac{\sum_{p=1}^{vp}\Bigg[\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{vs_{p}}\Bigg[\bigg(\frac{|mean_{p}-measured_{i}|}{mean_{p}}\bigg)*100\Bigg]}{vs_{p}}\Bigg]}{vp}
\end{equation}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A checkerboard target was scanned 10 times at a distance of $\sim2.2$m from camera projector system. 
\item 6 individual lengths were measured using 3D data from scanner and compared against true values.
\item So, for our experiments we set $N$=10,vp=6.

\frametitle{Conclusions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Combination of binary coded and phase shift algorithm provides more 3D resolution than simple binary codes and higher noise resilience than phase shifted approach.     
\item Experimental system with measurement accuracy and precision within 1\% at distance of $\sim2.2$m from system.
