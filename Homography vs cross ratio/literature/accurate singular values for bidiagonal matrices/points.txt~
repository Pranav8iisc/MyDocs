#1. Page 2 'relative accuracy' & 'realtive precision' have been used interchangeably.

#2. Claim: Accuracy of computed singular value(of A) will be same as that of individual matrix elements of A.

#3. High relative accuracy for the singular elements of bidiagonal matrix is 'guaranteed'.

#4. Porposed algorithm is variation over standard QR iteration.
