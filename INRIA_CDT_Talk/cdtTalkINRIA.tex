	\frametitle{Motivation}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Nuclear reactor component modelling-FIGURE OF FUEL ASSEMBLY INPUT and AFTER 3D DELAUNAY MESH:
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Designing reactor core.	
				\end{enumerate}		
			\item Resulting mesh should have elements suitable for CFD calculations:
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Constrained Delaunay Tetrahedralization is optimal domain discretization approach for Finite element applications[REFERENCE??]
						\begin{enumerate}
							\item Maximizes minimum dihedral angle(\textit{Delaunay property})
							\item [PROPERTIES SPECIFIC TO CDT??]	
						\end{enumerate}		
				\end{enumerate}

		\begin{enumerate}
			\item A simplical complex is \textit{constrained Delaunay} if there exist a circumsphere which encloses no other \textit{visible} point inside it.[FIGURE???]
			\item Constrained Delaunay Tetrahedralization is a simplical complex of constrained Delunay cells.

		\frametitle{Theoretical underpinnings}
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item	Schewchuck's CDT existence theorem[REFERENCE??]
					\begin{enumerate}
						\item If X is edge protected then CDT of X exists.[ELABORATE??]	
					\end{enumerate}		
				\item	Hang Si's Theorem[REFERENCE??]
					\begin{enumerate}
						\item If X has no local degeneracy and DT of X contains all segments of X, then CDT of X exists.[ELABORATE???] 
					\end{enumerate}		
			\end{enumerate}

				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Compute initial Delaunay Tetrahedralization	
					\item Recover constraint segments
					\item Remove local degeneracies
				\end{enumerate}
				\item Recover constraint facets
