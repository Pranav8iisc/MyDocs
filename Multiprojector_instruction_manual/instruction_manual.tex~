\section{Introduction}
This document describes the instructions for correctly running the Multi-projector geometric alignment and edge blending modules. Please note that this document is only a HOWTO and hence does not detail any explaination regarding why any particular step has been performed. Running multiprojector display calibration has 6 steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Startup the rendering cluster.
\item Position the camera in front of projection screen for computing camera-to-screen homography.
\item Run camera-screen homography estimation routine.
\item Run geometric alignment module.
\item Run edge-blending module.
\item Applying newly calculated calibration settings.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Addendum}
Screencast \textbf{running\_calibration.ogv} shows the calibration process, whereas screencast \textbf{applying\_settings.ogv} shows how to apply the newly calculated settings. In addition to the screencasts of the calibration process:
\begin{itemize}
\item Press key \textbf{\lq y\rq}(case-sensitive) to capture image on \textbf{Camera\_view} window.
\item While running \textbf{./feature\_projection.sh}, press key \textbf{\lq n\rq}(case-sensitive)(on its program window) to project checkerboard on the next projector.
\item Press \textbf{\lq ESC\rq} key to stop execution of \textbf{./feature\_projection.sh}(on its program window).
\item Press 
\end{itemize}
