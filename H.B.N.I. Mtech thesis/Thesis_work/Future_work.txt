1.Synchronization of camera & projector.
2.Improve region growing to allow for larger region scan without seg fault.
3.Remove mis-alignment between phase-shift pattern & binary coded pattern
4.Implement gray coded pattern to see if decoding error reduces.
5.Correct the exposure control of webcam.
6.Provision for phase-unwrapping algorithm.
7.Analyse & compare previous 2 implemented triangulation methods.
