#TARGET: Multiprojector geoemtetric & radiomatric seamlessness with issues

Geometric alignment:
#1. Demostration of effect number of points in grid on multiprojector geometric registration accuracy. 
#2. Demostration of issue related to limitation due to feature size.
#3. Explanation of Geometric alignment approach involving regularization through line fitting+ approach involving extension to include
boundaries of projection region as well.
