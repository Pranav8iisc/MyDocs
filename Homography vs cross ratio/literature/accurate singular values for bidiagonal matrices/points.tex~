\title{Notes on paper `\textit{Accurate singular values for bidiagonal matrix, J Demmel et al.}'}
\maketitle
Here, I will add main points which I understand while reading the paper.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Page 2 `relative accuracy' and `realtive precision' have been used interchangeably.
\item Claim: Accuracy of computed singular value(of A) will be same as that of individual matrix elements of A.
\item High relative accuracy for the singular elements of bidiagonal matrix is `guaranteed'.
\item Proposed algorithm is a variation over standard QR iteration.
\item Hybrid algorithm with \textit{QR-iteration} with \textit{zero-shifted} QR modified to provide \textit{forward stability}.
\item \textit{Iterative} QR approach iteratively applies QR decomposition to the transformed bidiagonal matrix untill it becomes diagonal. But \textbf{convergence guarantee}???
\end{enumerate}
