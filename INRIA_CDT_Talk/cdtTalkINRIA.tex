	\frametitle{Motivation}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Nuclear reactor component modelling-FIGURE OF FUEL ASSEMBLY INPUT and AFTER 3D DELAUNAY MESH:
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Designing reactor core.	
				\end{enumerate}		
			\item Resulting mesh should have elements suitable for CFD calculations:
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Reference from good elements for finite element method.	
				\end{enumerate}		
		\end{enumerate}
