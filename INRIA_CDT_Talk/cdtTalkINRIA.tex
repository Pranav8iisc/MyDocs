			\begin{itemize}
				\item CFD analysis for Nuclear reactor component modelling:
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Designing reactor core:

			\begin{itemize}
				\item Anupravaha
					\begin{itemize}
						\item General purpose CFD solver over hybrid unstructured grid.
						\item Collaboration project between BARC and other academic institutions.
						\item Integrated mesh generation and CFD solver:
							\begin{itemize}
								\item Currently, no open source software  with iterative feedback based hybrid mesh generation capability.
								\item Need to have tighter control over configurability of mesh generation and solver tools.	
							\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\begin{frame}	
		\frametitle{Motivation(contd.)}	
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Resulting mesh should have elements suitable for finite element calculations:
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Constrained Delaunay Tetrahedralization is optimal domain discretization approach for Finite element applications \cite{schewFiniteElements}.
							\begin{itemize}
								\item Preserves input domain in output mesh.
								\item Shares characterstics with Delaunay triangulation \cite{schewCDTExistence}	
								\item Maximizes minimum dihedral angle(\textit{Delaunay property}) \cite{schewFiniteElements}.
