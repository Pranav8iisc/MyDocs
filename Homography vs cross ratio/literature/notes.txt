'Conventional' SVD algorithm:
=> Compute bidiagonal form of 'A'
   Studying...
    =>Seems like we have to first study the convergence analysis of SVD(iterative in nature, where convergence depends on error in data)
convergence analysis=> error analysis{first show that it converges, then show how much error after it has converged}


=> Compute SVD of bidiagonal matrix(or, the bidiagonal SVD)





////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Questions
1. Are bidiagonal matrix and original matrix equivalent(with respect to which operation??)?
   No, but A is represented as UBdV where U,V are orthonormal matrices and Bd is the bidiagonal matrix
